    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I learned how to use Bezier curves, the de Casteljau algorithm, and to manipulate triangle mesh
      to create geometric models. I thought the most interesting yet challenging part was the subdivision loop. It
      brought together all of the edge spliting algorithms and concepts that the earlier parts of the project had been
      building on. I like visually seeing how the method could take a very rudimentary geometric model and smooth it out
      into a detailed and aesthetically pleasing mesh.

    <b>
      Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
    </b>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive and geometric method for creating Bezier curves. It linearly interpolates
      between pairs of adjacent points to gradually define a curve until it reaches a desired level of precision.
    </p>
    <br>

    To implement this algorithm:
    <ls>
      <li>Initialize an empty list for storing the new set of interpolated points.</li>

      <li>Iterate through input points to calculate intermediate points</li>

      <li>For each pair of adjacent points in the input vector (points[i] and points[i + 1]), calculate an
        interpolated point using the formula</li>

      <li>Add new point to the vector</li>

      <li>Return the vector containing the new set of points.</li>
    </ls>

    <br>


    <b>

      Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
      evaluate Bezier surfaces.
    </b>
    <p>
      The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended from curves to surfaces, working in three dimensions.
      <br>
      <br>
      To implement this algorithm:
      <ls>
        <li>
          evaluateStep(...): implemented the same way at part 1 but this time works with 3D points instead of 2D points
        </li>
        <li>evaluate1D(...): fully evaluates a 1D Bezier curve by repeatedly calling evaluateStep(...) on the set of 3D
          points until only one point remains. The function returns this point, which is the point on the curve at t.
        </li>
        <li>evaluate(...): evaluates the Bezier surface at parameters u and v by first evaluating intermediate points
          along each row of the control grid at u ( essentially we treat each row as a separate Bezier curve). Then, it
          takes these intermediate points (essentially defining a new set of control points that form a Bezier curve in
          the v direction) and evaluates this "vertical" curve at v.</li>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
    </b>
    <p>
      Starting from one of the half-edges coming out of the vertex, follow the next pointers to visit each adjacent face
      exactly once. Since each face is a triangle, using `h->next()->next()` brings us back to the original vertex in a
      triangle, and truncated versions of this helps us navigate around the vertex.
      <br>
      For each face, use the cross product of two sides of the triangle to calculate the normal vector. Then add the
      weighted sums of these normals.

      <br>Finally, normalize the sum of the area-weighted triangles to get the unit normal vector at the vertex.
      <br>This method provides a smooth approximation of the vertex normal, which creates a smooth shading effects in
      rendering.

      Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /

    </b>
    <p>
      First, I started by identifying all the half-edges, vertices, and faces involved in the flip. This includes the two triangles faces sharing the edge, the four vertices of these two triangles, the four relevant edges, the five half-edges, and the five twin edges.
<br>
      Then, I reassigned the vertices, edges, faces, to reflect their new associated parts after the flip. Finally, I adjusted the remaining halfedges to ensure that they point to a valid half-edge after the flip.

      Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
    </b>
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time debugging an issue with the faces not appearing after the flip. I noticed that whenever I’d hover my mouse over the post-flip edges, sometimes the wrong edge would highlight pink. This indicated that there was some issue with the edge assignments in my flipping method. 
<br>
      After reading some of the comments on the Ed thread and also debugging using the the half-edge ids, I realized that I also needed to reassign the twin edge values.

    </p>
    <br>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation /
      debugging tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      My method first identifies the relevant halfedges, vertices, and faces and initializes 6 new half edges, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and ine new vertex to return. 
<br>Then, I set up neighbors for each halfedge to correctly render the mesh structure after the split. I update the vertices to point to the correct outgoing halfedges. The new vertex is the midpoint between two of the existing vertices. 
<br>Finally, I update the halfedge pointers for the existing and newly created edges. This method returns an iterator to the newly inserted vertex.

    <b>
      Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
    </b>
    <p>
      While implementing the edge splitting algorithm, one issue I kept on running into was that the lines for the split would render, but one of the four split faces would not appear. It turns out that I was reassigning some edge vertices too early so the original pointer was lost. 
    </p>
    <br>



    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging
      tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      First, I iterated over all vertices of the original mesh to compute their new positions based on the weighted average formula given. I store these positions in Vertex::newPosition. Then, I split every edge of the mesh by iterating over all edges and applying the edge split operation and add these points to Edge::newPosition. 
<br>One important part is flipping any new edges that connect an old and new vertex. 
<br>Finally, I iterate over all vertices in the now subdivided mesh and update their positions with the values stored in Vertex::newPosition into the final Vertex::position. 
<br>For debugging, I visually inspected the mesh before any splitting and flipping operations to ensure that vertices were being correctly inserted. In addition, I followed a tip from a TA to use the Vertex::isNew and Edge::isNew flags to differentiate between original and newly created vertices and edges. This was helpful for applying the weighted average formula and deciding which edges to flip.

    </p>
    <br>


    <b>
      Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision.
      What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
    </b>
    <p>
      It seems that the sharp edges smooth out because the algorithm averages vertex positions based on their neighbors. This creates a more rounded appearance in the subdivided mesh.
<br>If you strategically pre-split some edges, this might be able to create a mesh that approximates the sharp features more accurately and can help maintain the model's overall sharpness.

      Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes
      slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that
      the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your
      pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
    </b>
    <p>
      I preprocess the cube by splitting each face of the cube so that it had a X-shaped split instead of a diagonal split. This way when we apply the loop subdivision, it divides each quarter triangle evenly instead of lopsidedly averaging each half triangle.
